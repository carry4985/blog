#HTML Quotation and Citation Elements & HTML Computer Code Elements

##HTML \<q> for Short Quotations

The HTML \<q> element defines a short quotation.

Browsers usually insert quotation marks around the \<q> element.

	<p>WWF's goal is to: <q>Build a future where people live in harmony with nature.</q></p>
	
##HTML \<blockquote> for Long Quotations

The HTML \<blockquote> element defines a quoted section.

Browsers usually indent \<blockquote> elements.

	<p>Here is a quote from WWF's website:</p>
	<blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
	For 50 years, WWF has been protecting the future of nature.
	The world's leading conservation organization,
	WWF works in 100 countries and is supported by
	1.2 million members in the United States and
	close to 5 million globally.
	</blockquote>
	
	
##HTML \<abbr> for Abbreviations
The HTML \<abbr> element defines an abbreviation or an acronym.

Marking abbreviations can give useful information to browsers, translation systems and search-engines.


	<p>The <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> was founded in 1948.</p>

##HTML \<address> for Contact Information
	
The HTML \<address> element defines contact information (author/owner) of a document or article.

The \<address> element is usually displayed in italic. Most browsers will add a line break before and after the element.

	<address>
	Written by John Doe.<br> 
	Visit us at:<br>
	Example.com<br>
	Box 564, Disneyland<br>
	USA
	</address>


##HTML \<cite> for Work Title
The HTML \<cite> element defines the title of a work.

Browsers usually display \<cite> elements in italic.


	<p><cite>The Scream</cite> by Edvard Munch. Painted in 1893.</p>


##HTML \<bdo> for Bi-Directional Override
The HTML \<bdo> element defines bi-directional override.

The \<bdo> element is used to override the current text direction:


	<bdo dir="rtl">This text will be written from right to left</bdo>
	
##HTML Computer Code Formatting

HTML normally uses variable letter size and spacing.

This is not wanted when displaying examples of computer code.

The \<kbd>, \<samp>, and \<code> elements all support fixed letter size and spacing.

HTML \<kbd> For Keyboard Input

The HTML \<kbd> element defines keyboard input

	<kbd>File | Open...</kbd>
	
##HTML \<samp> For Computer Output

	<samp>
	demo.example.com login: Apr 12 09:10:17
	Linux 2.6.10-grsec+gg3+e+fhs6b+nfs+gr0501+++p3+c4a+gr2b-reslog-v6.189
	</samp>

##HTML \<code> For Computer Code

The HTML \<code> element defines a piece of programming code:

	<code>
	var x = 5;
	var y = 6;
	document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x + y;
	</code>
	
Notice that the \<code> element does not preserve extra whitespace and line-breaks.

To fix this, you can put the \<code> element inside a \<pre> element:

	<pre>
	<code>
	var x = 5;
	var y = 6;
	document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x + y;
	</code>
	</pre>
	
##HTML \<var> For Variables
The HTML \<var> element defines a variable.

The variable could be a variable in a mathematical expression or a variable in programming context:

	Einstein wrote: <var>E</var> = <var>m</var><var>c</var><sup>2</sup>.
