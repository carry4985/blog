#HTML Headings & The HTML \<pre> Element
##HTML Horizontal Rules
The \<hr> tag creates a horizontal line in an HTML page.

The hr element can be used to separate content:

	<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
	<hr>
	<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
	<hr>
	<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
	
##The HTML \<head> Element

The HTML \<head> element has nothing to do with HTML headings.
	
The HTML \<head> element contains meta data. Meta data are not displayed.
	
The HTML \<head> element is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag:
	
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	
	<head>
	  <title>My First HTML</title>
	  <meta charset="UTF-8">
	</head>
	
	<body>
	.
	.
	.
	
##The HTML \<title> Element

The HTML \<title> element is meta data. It defines the HTML document's title.

The title will not be displayed in the document, but might be displayed in the browser tab.

##The HTML \<meta> Element
The HTML \<meta> element is also meta data.

It can be used to define the character set, and other information about the HTML document.

##More Meta Elements

In the chapter about HTML styles you discover more meta elements:

The HTML \<style> element is used to define internal CSS style sheets.

The HTML \<link> element is used to define external CSS style sheets.

##The HTML \<pre> Element

The HTML \<pre> element defines preformatted text.

The text inside a \<pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:

	<pre>
	  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
	
	  My Bonnie lies over the sea.
	
	  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
	
	  Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
	</pre>
