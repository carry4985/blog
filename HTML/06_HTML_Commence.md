#HTML Comments

##HTML Comment Tags
You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax:
	
	<!-- Write your comments here -->
	
Comments are not displayed by the browser, but they can help document your HTML.

With comments you can place notifications and reminders in your HTML:

	<!-- This is a comment -->
	
	<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
	
	<!-- Remember to add more information here -->
	
Comments are also great for debugging HTML, because you can comment out HTML lines of code, one at a time, to search for errors:

	<!-- Do not display this at the moment
	<img border="0" src="pic_mountain.jpg" alt="Mountain">
	-->

##Conditional Comments

	<!--[if IE 8]>
	    .... some HTML here ....
	<![endif]-->
	
	
##Software Program Tags

HTML comments tags can also be generated by various HTML software programs.

For example \<!--webbot bot--> tags wrapped inside HTML comments by FrontPage and Expression Web.

As a rule, let these tags stay, to help support the software that created them.
