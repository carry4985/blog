主题句尽量写的抽象！例如：

\==================================

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is not a good thing to move to a new city or a new country because of the loss of old friends.

主题句： With the development of modern technology, distance is no longer a problem for friends today.

explantion: Thanks to advanced means of communication and transportation, friends living on different sides of the world can still keep in touch or even visit each other if they wish.

举例子: Take my best friend, John, and I for example. We used to be roommates two years ago, but John then moved to Boston with his families. Since we used to have a tradition that we had boys' meetings almost every night, we would like to keep that. Thus, we bought lap-top computers with cameras and we both registered accounts of Facebook and Skype, which allowed us to chat online anytime. John even flew back to see me during Christmas twice, and when it comes to summer, it would be my turn to visit him and his family in the US. In this case, we can see that distance does not always harm relationship.

##何为单一解释？

用两个或三个段落正向支持某一简单结论的论述方式。

一边倒---全部正向支持

让步--将不利条件转化为有利或无害条件

单一解释型文章为最常见论述法，几乎适用于所有题目
