##综合写作例子

第一段：交代文章和听力说什么（the passage and the lecture are mainly about sth），交代文章和听力怎么认为的，说两者的关系。（according to the passage。。。however，the lecture...）

The passage and the lecture have contradictory opinions on the reason of Anasazi Indian;s disappearance. According to the passage, Anasazi died out because of war; however, the professor argues that it has actually a water shortage which led to their extinction.

The author mentions that the Anasazi must have been invaded by other tribes, for some of their settlements and even ritual sites were destroyed in fire. Nevertheless, the professor points out that it was Anasazi themselves who burned the sites, because they were holding ceremonies to beg their gods to help them find new sites with water supplies, so it had nothing to do with war.

第三段一样

do not result in inaccurate 

well organized and well developed explanations, exemplifications and/or details 事理论证, 事例论证

unity,progression, coherence

syntactic variety, appropriate word choice, idiomaticity, minor lexical or grammatical errors

主题句尽量写的抽象！例如：

\==================================

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is not a good thing to move to a new city or a new country because of the loss of old friends.

主题句： With the development of modern technology, distance is no longer a problem for friends today.

explantion: Thanks to advanced means of communication and transportation, friends living on different sides of the world can still keep in touch or even visit each other if they wish.

举例子: Take my best friend, John, and I for example. We used to be roommates two years ago, but John then moved to Boston with his families. Since we used to have a tradition that we had boys' meetings almost every night, we would like to keep that. Thus, we bought lap-top computers with cameras and we both registered accounts of Facebook and Skype, which allowed us to chat online anytime. John even flew back to see me during Christmas twice, and when it comes to summer, it would be my turn to visit him and his family in the US. In this case, we can see that distance does not always harm relationship.

##何为单一解释？

用两个或三个段落正向支持某一简单结论的论述方式。

一边倒---全部正向支持

让步--将不利条件转化为有利或无害条件

单一解释型文章为最常见论述法，几乎适用于所有题目

作业 在线联系 12个

##行文逻辑

首先说阅读和听力都说了什么，然后说关系怎么样。

##让步类单一解释型文章

###让步的条件

当且仅当出现了明显不利于己方观点的条件，且该条件无法忽略时

###让步的准则

让步之后必须立刻进行削弱和反驳，将不利条件进行转化

###让步的使用

能不让步，一步不让（是否让步与逻辑能力或辩证思维毫无关系）



##缺一不可型论述方法

###缺一不可型论述：

在仅有两个选项的对比情况下，证明两者同样重要的论证方式

###缺一不可的原因：

对比两个选项时，发现的确没有一方明显超过另一方。没有可比性，有互补性。

###缺一不可的使用：

中间两段，结构相同，篇幅相当，双线扩展

###举例

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Cars have more effects on human beings than airplanes do.

第一句话：给出文章的背景，以稀疏平常的现象引出核心词。

Cars and airplanes are both significant inventions in human civilization and they influence our lives in different ways.(背景） These days, we often hear people say that the influence of cars far outweighs which of planes, for they are used more frequently. However, I believe this is a misunderstanding, for importance is not just a matter of the frequency of usage. （引出反方观点）Automobiles and jets complete each other by playing different yet indispensable parts in out lives, so we cannot value one more than the other.（自己的观点）

With cars, our trips will be fun and flexible. If there is no limit of time, most people would choose to travel by having a road trip, taking pictures for beautiful sceneries, enjoying wonderful foods all along the journey. But yet jets, they have no chioce but to sit tight, even without being allowed to use their cell phones, not to mention that foods on planes are usually bad-tasting. Also, cars can be parked anywhere they can go, but airplanes need to be land at an airport, which is not seen everywhere. In other words, cars can directly take people to their destinations; jets, however, still need to be assisted by other trans[orts to deliver their passangers to where they want to go. We often see that people drive their cars to offices, schools and supermarkets, but such places are not even able to accommodate helicopters, not to mention jets. It is quite obvious that cars can do the parts that planes never do and we cannot live without them.

Although automobiles enjoy many advantages, we still need planes to make the society function for the time they save and the possibility they offer. For international or intercontinental traveling, airplanes would always be the primary choice, as most people do not want to waste too much time on the way. The saved time could be used in lots of more meaningful ways like having a good rest, preparing for a conference or visiting a friend. In addition, people taking airplanes usually do not worry about what is between where they leave and where they go. However, cars can be blocked by oceans, rivers, moutains ad forests, which makes them not even practical options when traveling to some destinations. No matter how off-road a car is, it has limitations in the face of a varied topography, which has not influence on planes at all. Airplanes' merits make them perfect choices on many occasions when cars are not capable or suitable, and living without them is also unthinkable.

Since cars and planes cannot replace each other while both handling important tasks, it would be illogical to claim that the influence of one kind is greater than the other's. 

##内部变量

###内部变量型论述

在二选一的情况下，证明不同的人会有不同选择的论述方法

###内部变量的原因

给出的两个选项的却各有千秋，以防很难完胜另一方

###内部变量的使用

中间两段，结构相同，篇幅相当，双线扩展。

题目：一个比另一个更重要

1.以稀疏平常的现象引出核心词汇，反方论点，我的论点：以年龄分层。

2.对年轻人，电话好，电视不好。

3.对老年人，电视好，电话不好。

###缺一不可型特例

交朋友： make fun； who can help us.？important

单一解释： make fun： 可以与任何人have fun，举例：广场舞，出租车司机。此外，成为朋友也不一定重要。

相反：help us: 遇到困难有安全感，举例去外地交本地朋友；此外，主动提供帮助，举例：父母给我的帮助让我比一般人好。

总结：help us重要；一起have fun，没有非常多的价值。

***

学习概念比了解事实重要？

第一段：学习不容易.一些人说.然而，以偏概全.事实上，事实是概念的基础，概念帮助了解事实。

第二段：概念和观点告诉我们如何应用于事实，同样能够帮助我们记忆更有效。举例，英语学习时混淆important和significant；此外，学习概念能让我们更好的记忆，比如当我们知道两个canopy和understory的关系时，更好理解热带雨林。

第三段，相似，准确的事实记忆保证我们成功的引用概念，事实能让我们更好理解概念想出新的想法。做数学题我们需要记住公式，记住历史时要准确的记住人名和时间。否则就会缺少基本信息让人信服。同样，读历史会发现相同的事情重复发生。这些故事提醒我们避免犯错，更好理解。

第四段，总结。

***

在异乡和在故乡成功？

分为年轻人和老年人。

对年轻人来说freedom是happier。不会被lecture，better job，better marriage。

年长者来说，aged people故乡有很多朋友，家庭成员，对一切都熟悉。the sense of belonging。如果在异乡lonely。对老年人来说身体健康更重要。environment，climate，weather。used to it。食物。

***

##外部变量法

###外变量型论述

君子相时而动，即不同情况下我们做出不同选择的论述方式

###外部变量的原因

当被问到yes or no的选择时，我们发现选择不可能一成不变

###外部变量的使用

中间两段，篇幅相当，双线扩展 or 全幅扩展

##外部变量范文

想要成功，应该与别人不同而不是与别人相同。

第一段：成功有好多种，有人相同，有人不同；在学习工作中应该与人不同，日常生活与人相同。

第二段：与众不同的人可以抓住重要的人的眼球获得机会。catch the eye of。。。竞争激烈，变得好不够，不同才让人记住。乔布斯，手机和别人不一样。又好又不同，很受欢迎。

第三段：融入别人的生活，爸爸穿奇装异服，被人误解。后来跟人一样世界编号，交到了朋友。

第四段：不一样能带来很多选择，和别人一样带来更多朋友。有不同的策略

***

爷爷的建议不管用，因为世界改变了。

第一段，需要建议时有很多。一些人求助同辈人，一些人求助父母。很少有人求助老年人因为时间变化快。但是虽然变化很快，许多事仍然还是以传统的方式运行。所以祖父母可以是很好的建议者。

第二段，祖父母没遇到过的事不会有有价值的信息。当comes to科技，祖父母甚至不知道他们的存在，not to mention teaching us 如何去用。很多的祖父母认为上网是有害的，因为他们认为影响孩子学习。但是这很不明智。限制孩子上网使孩子不可能接受到环球新闻深不不能交作业。因为祖父母没有从中受益，所以很消极看待。

第三段，但是说祖父母的建议不在游泳is still a rigid approach，因为他们在熟悉的方面会是很好的老师。和别人吵架了，祖父劝我冷静一下。多亏了他的建议，道歉有用。

第四段，祖父是special teachers，可能好经验也可能没有经验，我们需要认清问题然后决定是否ask advice from them。

Because the employees are forced to work overtime everyday and what's more the assignment are so overwhelming that sometimes they even have to bring their work back home on weekends and on holidays. Even they are equiped with technical equipments to make them more efficient, the greed of bosses go even futher.

##缺一不可(双线扩展 real test topic 2)

1. a person that does what the group wants him to do, or a person that hold strong opinions different from what the group wants. / How to succeed? Some people believe it is important to hold on to their views. Others believe we should embrace new ideas.

	(1)of course a group need people to do what the group wants him to do. Without cooperation, no plans can be carried out and no ideas can be realized. If people are unwilling to do what the team want him to do, even good plans could fail, not to mention bad ones.

2. Some people believe that taking field trips (e.g. going to the museum) is an important part of children's education. Others believe that it is better for children to study at school.

	(1)These two kinds of education are both beneficial to children. Before children have start their formal education, like they are in kindergarten. Children at these ages won't even lack the self control to disipline themselves in classes. And they are likely to walk around while they are supposed to be sitting down. They are likely to talk back to teachers because they are not educated by their parents that well. Taking them to a museum or a zoo will be a very good way to learn.
	
	(1)Even if they attend the primary school,
