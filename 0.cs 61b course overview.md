推荐书head first java

##goals of CS 61B

1. learning efficient data structures&algorithms
2. design & write large programs
3. understanding & designing data abstraction & interfaces
4. learn Java

##object-oriented programming

**Object**

repository of data {milk jam} my list is an object of class shoping list

**Class** 

type of object

**Method**

procedure function that operates on an object(or class)

**Inheritance** 
		
a class can inherit properties from a more general class. ShopingList inherits from List class the property of storing a sequence of items.

**Polymorphhism**

one method all works on several classes, even if the classes need different implementations. e.g. “addItem” method on every kind of List, even though adding item to ShoppingList si different from ShoppingCart.

**Object-oriented**:

each object knows its own class & method. Each ShoppingList & ShoppingCart knows which addItem method it uses.
	
	
##Java
**2 ways to get classes**

	1.use one defined by someone else. Java has tons.

	2.define one yourself.
	
**must “declare” any variable before using it.**
	
	
	String myString;
	myString = new String();
	
**2 distinct steps**

	1.“new String()” is called a constructor.
	
	2.assignment “=” causes myString to reference the object.

**Diffs between Java&Scheme**

	1. everything in Java has a type;you must declare it.
	
	2. java execution must be compiled.
