# Overview

two distinct approach to autonomous development:

* a robotics approach
* a deep learning approach

robotics approach uses output from a suite of sensors to directly measure the vehicle surroundings and then navigate accordingly

a deep learning approach allow self-driving cars to learn how to drive by mimicking human driving behavior
