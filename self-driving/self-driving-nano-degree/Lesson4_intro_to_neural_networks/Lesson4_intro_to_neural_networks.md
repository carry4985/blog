# Introduction to Neural Networks

## Linear Regression

Draw a line to best fit the data. 

How to find the line? 

1. start by drawing a random line and see how bad this line is:

	to compute the error, LSM

2. minimize the error

	general procedure is known as gradient descent.

## Logistic Regression

Find a best line to cut the data.
	
draw a random line and then gradient descent to minimize the error function: the number of incorrect points.

## Neural network

Our computer could do one thing at a time, so we divide the data by two lines.

## Perceptron

Or artificial neurons, they are the basic unit of a neural network.

### Weights

When input comes into a perception, it gets multiplied by a weight value that is assigned to this particular input. The network adjusts the weights based on any errors in categorization that results from the previous weights. This is called training the NN.

A higher weights means more important, otherwise.

### Summing the input data
