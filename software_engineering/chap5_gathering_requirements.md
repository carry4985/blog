# Software quality

Software runs on some hardware and is developed for a purpose that is related to human activities.

Quality is relative with `functions` and `purposes`.

Requirements engineering is mostly about identifying the purposes.

* Often, people don't know what they want until you show it to them
* Changing requirements
* Multiple stakeholders with conflicting requirements

 Completeness and pertinence
