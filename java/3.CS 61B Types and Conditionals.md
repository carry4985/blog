##PRIMITIVE TYPES
byte: 8-bit integer -128...127

short: 16-bit integer -32768...32767

int: 32-bit -214783648..2147483647

long: 64-bit

double: 64-bit floating point number

float: 32-bit

boolean: "true" or "false"

char: A character
<lang:java ->
	
	long x = 124L;
	float f = 18.9f;

**double&float values must have a decimal pt**

<lang:java ->
	
	double y = 18.0;

java.lang library:

**--Math class**

<lang:java ->

	x = Math.abs(y);//absolute value of 
	//Math.sqrt, sin ...

**--Integer class**

<lang:java ->

	int x = Integer.parseInt("1984") //from string to int

**--Double class**

<lang:java ->

	double d = Double.parseDouble("3.14") //from string to double
	
**Integers can be assigned to variables of long types.**

<lang:java ->

	int i = 43;
	long l = 43L;
	l = i; //Okay
	i = l; //Compiler ERROR
	i = (int)l; //Okay, int is a cast

**--Boolean values**

|a	|b	|	a && b	|	a &#124;&#124; b|!a|
|-------|-------|------------|--------|------|
|false|false|false|f|t|
|f|t|f|t| |
|t|f|f|t|f|
|t|t|t|t| |

**--Created by comparison operators**

`==` `>` `<` `>=` `<=` `!=`
<lang:java ->

	boolean x = 3 == 5; //false
	x = 4.5 >= 4.5; //true
	x = 4 != 5 - 1; //false
	x = false == (3 == 0); //true
	
##CONFITIONALS
<lang:java ->

	boolean pass = score >= 75;
	if (pass){
		System.out.println("You pass CS 61B");
	} else {
		//score < 75
		System.out.println("You are an unbelievable loser!");
	}
	
if-then-else clauses can be:

1. nested
2. daisy-chained

Nesting allows you to build decision trees. Daisy-chaining allows you to present more than two alternatives. For instance, suppose you want to find the maximum of three numbers.

Find maximum of 3 numbers:
<lang:java ->
	
	if (x > y) {
	    if (x > z) {
	        maximum = x;
	    } else {
	        maximum = z;
	    }
	} else if (y > z) {
	    maximum = y;
	} else {
	    maximum = z;
	}

Some long chains of if-then-else clauses can be simplified by using a "switch" statement. "switch" is appropriate only if every condition tests whether a variable x is equal to some constant.

<lang:java ->

	switch (month) {        |      if (month == 2) {                         
	case 2:                 |        days = 28;                              
	  days = 28;            |      } else if ((month == 4) || (month == 6) ||
	  break;                |                 (month == 9) || (month == 11)) {
	case 4:                 |        days = 30;                              
	case 6:                 |      } else {                                  
	case 9:                 |        days = 31;                              
	case 11:                |      }                                         
	  days = 30;            |
	  break;
	default:
	  days = 31;
	  break;
	}                   //  These two code fragments do exactly the same thing.

**IMPORTANT:** "break" jumps to the end of the "switch" statement. If you forget a break statement, the flow of execution will continue right through past the next "case" clause, which is why cases 4, 6, and 9 work right. If month == 12 in the following example, both Strings are printed.

<lang:java ->

	switch (month) {
	case 12:
	    output("It's December.");
	    // Just keep moving right on through.
	case 1:
	case 2:
	case 11:
	    output("It's cold.");
	}
However, this is considered bad style, because it's hard to read and understand. If there's any chance that other people will need to read or modify your code (which is the norm when you program for a business), don't code it like this. Use break statements in the switch, and use subroutines to reuse code and clarify the control flow.

Observe that the last example doesn't have a "default:" case. If "month" is not 1 nor 2 nor 11 nor 12, Java jumps right to the end of the "switch" statement (just past the closing brace) and continues execution from there.

##THE "return" KEYWORD

Like conditionals, "return" affects the flow of control of a program. It causes a method to end immediately, so that control returns to the calling method.

Here's a recursive method that prints the numbers from 1 to x.

<lang:java ->

	public static void oneToX(int x) {
	    if (x < 1) {
	        return;
	    }
	    oneToX(x - 1);
	    System.out.println(x);
	}
	
	
The return keyword serves a dual purpose: it is also the means by which a function returns a value. A function is a method that is declared to return a non-void type. For instance, here's a function that returns an int.

<lang:java ->

	public int daysInMonth(int month) {
	    switch (month) {
	    case 2:
	        return 28;
	    case 4:
	    case 6:
	    case 9:
	    case 11:
	        return 30;
	    default:
	        return 31;
	    }
	}
	
The "return" value can be an expression. Some examples:
<lang:java ->

	return x + y - z;
	
	return car.velocity(time);
